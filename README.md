# RN41-42

An Arduino library for interaction with Microchip RN41 and RN42 Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR modules over serial and GPIO connections.

It is based off of the work of [Nick Oliver](https://developer.mbed.org/users/NoLiver92/) on his ARM mbed repository [RN41](https://developer.mbed.org/users/NoLiver92/code/RN41/).

This version has been ported to Arduino with added functionality by Chris Spegal.
